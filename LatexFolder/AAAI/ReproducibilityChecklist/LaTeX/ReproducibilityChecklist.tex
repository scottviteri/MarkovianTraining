\section*{Reproducibility Checklist}

\vspace{1em}
\hrule
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Instructions for Authors:}

This document outlines key aspects for assessing reproducibility. Please provide your input by editing this \texttt{.tex} file directly.

For each question (that applies), replace the ``Type your response here'' text with your answer.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Example:} If a question appears as
%
\begin{center}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth}
\ttfamily\raggedright
\string\question \{Proofs of all novel claims are included\} \{(yes/partial/no)\} \\
Type your response here
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
you would change it to:
\begin{center}
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth}
\ttfamily\raggedright
\string\question \{Proofs of all novel claims are included\} \{(yes/partial/no)\} \\
yes
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%
Please make sure to:
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{.1em}
\item Replace ONLY the ``Type your response here'' text and nothing else.
\item Use one of the options listed for that question (e.g., \textbf{yes}, \textbf{no}, \textbf{partial}, or \textbf{NA}).
\item \textbf{Not} modify any other part of the \texttt{\string\question} command or any other lines in this document.\\
\end{itemize}

You can \texttt{\string\input} this .tex file right before \texttt{\string\end\{document\}} of your main file or compile it as a stand-alone document. Check the instructions on your conference's website to see if you will be asked to provide this checklist with your paper or separately.
