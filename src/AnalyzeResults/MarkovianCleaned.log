Action: "Reasoning:\n\n1. Add the first three numbers: 55 + 94 + 66 = 215\n2. Next, add the next four numbers: 215 + 38 + 37 + 48 = 308\n3. Lastly, add the remaining numbers: 308 + 28 + 23 + 10 + 39 + 81 + 63 + 6 + 95 + 65 = 648\n\nSo, the solution to the problem is 648. It was broken down into simpler subproblems that allowed us to add smaller sets of numbers together before finding the answer. This approach makes it easier to understand and perform complex calculations. In summary:\n\n1. Add 55, 94, 66\n2. Add 38, 37, 48\n3. Add 215, 28, 23, 10, 39, 81, 63, 6, 95, 65.\n= 648.\n\nThus, the final answer is 648.\n\nThis method makes it easy to understand the calculation process and reduces the chances of errors. In other words, break it down and conquer it!\n\nThis is especially useful when dealing with more complex equations or mathematical problems where keeping track of multiple terms and numbers can become overwhelming. By breaking down the problem into smaller parts, you can focus on one set of terms at a time, which in turn helps simplify the process and increase your overall understanding of the problem. It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle, solving it piece by piece is much simpler and less frustrating than trying to fit all pieces at once!\n\nOverall"

Split the sum into three parts: First, add the numbers from the beginning till 63, then add 95, and finally add the remaining numbers 6 and 65.\n\n3. Part 1: 55 + 94 + 66 + 38 + 37 + 48 + 28 + 23 + 10 + 39 = 336\n\n4. Part 2: 95\n\n5. Part 3: 6 + 65 = 71\n\n6.

To clarify, you have the sum of: 336 (numbers from 55 to 63 except for 63) + 95 (number 95) + 71 (numbers 6, 65). The answer is 492.\n\nThus, in summary, to calculate 55'

If there were more terms, you could continue this pattern, breaking down each subproblem into another, until all the terms have been added, yielding the final result. This method is called "subtraction and carrying" or "summation by carrying," but since we\'re dealing with addition only, it can be simply called decomposition by subproblems. As you can see, the method is very powerful and can be used to solve a wide range of arithmetic problems. However, keep in mind that this process becomes increasingly tedious when working with a large number of terms, and for that reason, we use tools like calculators to compute the sums directly with ease.

Default Action: 'Reasoning:\n\n1. The given expression is a sum of twelve addends.\n2. Splitting the expression into subproblems, we first find the sum of the first four addends: 32 + 84 + 74 + 54 = 194.\n3.

Finally, we find the sum of the original twelve addends by adding the sums found in step 2 and step 3: 194 + 333 = 527.\n\nSo, the solution is 527. This approach helps break the problem down into more manageable parts. In this problem, we are adding twelve numbers, so the problem can be easily divided into smaller subproblems of finding the sums of multiple addends.\n\nConfirmation: Perform the calculation in the following order: 32 + 84 + 74 + 54 + 31 + 20 + 27 + 74 + 71 + 45 + 71 + 62 + 29 + 20 + 42 = 194 + 333 = 527.

Default Action: 'Reasoning: Instead of directly adding all the given numbers, we will break down the problem into smaller subproblems by grouping the numbers into twos or threes for simpler addition.\n\nSolution: Let\'s group the numbers and add them up step by step.\n\n1.

Thus, the final answer is 400 + 99 = 499. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to add every number individually, you can do that as well and arrive at the same answer (with a more tedious calculation).\n\nFor convenience, we chose to group the calculation to make the addition process more manageable by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that could be solved more easily.

The steps you followed in this example were adding the two largest groups of numbers first. Any time order doesn't matter, you can also try breaking it down differently, such as by ones, twos, threes, or other patterns. For example, in your problem, you could have first added all the single-digit numbers to get 106, added 0, 6, and 15, then combined those results (111 + 6 = 117) with the large sum (173) to obtain the final answer. The method you use depends on your comfort level with addition and your desire for a straightforward or interesting mental challenge.

This is the essence of decomposing a complex problem into sub-problems or smaller, more manageable components. In mathematics, this is also known as the distributive property, which is a fundamental concept that aids in the manipulation of expressions and equations. In daily life, it is similar to breaking down a larger task into smaller tasks. The skill of decomposition effectively simplifies complex problems, making them less intimidating and easier to address. Overall, this question illustrated the importance of breaking down complex situations into smaller, more manageable pieces to make problem solving more efficient, accurate, and understandable.\n\nDecomposition of problems into manageable'

The problem is essentially a sequence of additions, and breaking it down into smaller subproblems/subadditions helps to simplify the problem. Adding the numbers one-by-one gives the same result, but breaking it down into smaller parts enhances the clarity and concise presentation of the solution. This problem-solving method is called decomposing problems into subproblems. Note: The decomposing problem-solving method could be used for a wide range of math problems, for instance, finding the sum, product, or difference of complex expressions, calculating area, volume, and even for solving equations. The main idea is to tackle a complex problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks while maintaining the overall goal of finding the final answer. By doing so, the computational complexity is reduced, which makes the problem easier to understand, and the solution can be presented in a more concise form. This method is called algebraic decomposition in mathematics, and it can also be applied in other fields such as computer science, physics, biology, and various other domains'

Decomposing a problem into smaller subproblems enables us to focus on smaller, more manageable pieces of the problem, making it easier to understand and find a solution. This can be particularly useful for complex problems, as it breaks down large, complicated problems into smaller, more manageable components.

Finally, add the total from step 1 and step 2: 311 + 531 = 842.\n\nSo, the sum of all the given numbers is 842.\n\nNote: The given sum contained pairs of the same numbers. That's why we separated them into subproblems to avoid unnecessary calculations. In general, we always try to simplify a problem by identifying patterns and decomposing it into simpler subproblems that are easier to solve. In this case, the presence of repeated numbers indicated an opportunity for calculating paired sums separately. This approach can save time, increase accuracy, and lead to a better understanding of the problem itself. Decomposing a complex problem into smaller, simpler problems is a common and effective problem-solving strategy used in mathematics and other areas of life. It can help us overcome challenges, increase productivity, and unlock new insights that can be crucial for success. In the realm of AI and machine learning, similar techniques, such as recursion, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and feature engineering, are often used to solve complex problems in a more efficient and effective manner. By breaking down a larger problem into smaller, more manageable components, we can make progress towards a solution step by step. This not only makes the problem more understandable but also provides us with a clearer understanding of the interdependencies and relationships"

In this case, it was crucial to add the numbers in pairs since there were no subtractions or divisions. If there were, the parentheses would be used differently. Nevertheless, we followed the same process and applied the same logic. By combining like terms and then summing the results, we arrived at the final answer. Also, make sure to understand that this method applies to similar types of problems. If you are working with equations that have subtraction or division or if the terms include multiplication or exponents, you will use parentheses differently. In those cases, the rule is to do the operations enclosed by the parentheses first. This way, we can perform the more complex or higher-precedence calculations before moving on to the simpler ones.

However, by breaking the problem down into smaller parts, we made the calculation more manageable and efficient. In real-life situations, decomposition is a fundamental problem-solving strategy used in various fields such as mathematics, science, engineering, and business. It allows us to tackle complex situations, find the right solutions, and make well-informed decisions. This approach is an essential skill that can help you save time, reduce stress, and increase your overall effectiveness. Additionally, decomposition enhances your ability to understand a complex problem by allowing you to focus on one piece at a time, improving your overall problem-solving capabilities.

Default Action: 'Reasoning:\n\n1. First, add all the two-digit numbers: 88 + 66 + 81 + 81 = 316\n2. Next, add the single-digit numbers and the number 39 (which was left from the previous step): 4 + 31 + 35 + 18 + 47 + 1 + 92 + 3 = 187\n3. Lastly, add the total from step 1 (316) and the total from step 2 (187): 316 + 187 = 503\n\nTherefore, the sum of 51 + 88 + 81 + 72 + 92 + 39 + 31 + 4 + 66 + 47 + 81 + 35 + 73 + 18 + 75 is 503.\n\nAlternatively, you could also solve the problem by doing all the additions sequentially: \n\n51 + 88 + 81 + 72 + 92 + 39 + 31 + 4 + 66 + 47 + 81 + 35 + 73 + 18 + 75 = 503.\n\nHowever, it\'s usually more efficient to group similar numbers together and solve them in parallel if possible. This approach is known as the "summing up in groups" or "grouping method". It can save you time and effort when performing complex calculations. In this case, we were able to reduce 13 additions down to just 2. However, in general, the number of possible groupings is 2^N-1, where N is the number'

Therefore, it is important to remember that the order of adding subproblems or their grouping does not always matter. The final solution will always be the same as long as all the subproblems and their results are added correctly. But in practice, some strategies might make the overall process more manageable.

Add 75 to the sum obtained in the previous step: 210 + 75 = 285\n\n5. Now, let's add 66 and 75: 66 + 75 = 141\n\n6. Finally, add the two numbers we calculated earlier: 30 and 141. \n\n7. The sum of all given numbers is then: 30 + 141 = 171.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 66 + 75 + 2 + 2 + 72 + 11 + 21 + 75 + 33 + 42 + 52 + 83 + 3 + 17 + 15 is equal to 171.\n\nAnswer: 171.\n\nHope this helps!

Action: 'Reasoning:\n\n1. Add two numbers: Define a function `add(x, y)` that returns `x + y`.\n2. Repeatedly add numbers: Use a loop (e.g., for loop) to apply the `add` function to every pair of sequential numbers in the list.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. First, create a list of input numbers: `sequence = [91, 40, 98, ...]`\n2. Define a helper function `add(x, y)` that computes the sum of two input numbers: `def add(x, y): return x + y`\n3. Use a for loop to process each pair of numbers in the sequence:\n\n```python\nresult = 0\nfor num1, num2 in zip(sequence, sequence[1:]):\n    result = add(result, num1)\n    result = add(result, num2)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis approach scales to arbitrary length sequences efficiently. It reduces the actual computation by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems. In the given example, the problem breaks into two subproblems - adding two numbers and iterating through the sequence. The for loop handles the iteration, and the `add` function deals with the addition of two numbers. This way, using the step-by-step approach, the problem gets decomposed by subproblems to a point where only basic arithmetic operations remain.\n\nYou may notice that this solution pattern is widely accepted in various domains such as programming, mathematics, and problem-solving strategies in general. To simplify complicated problems, we tend to break them down into their core component parts using this iterative approach. This process reduces the overall complexity and makes the problem more manageable'

Thus, the question demanded a step-by-step decomposition. After completing these steps, the final answer is 853. This breakdown allows us to better understand how the calculation is evolving. It is often helpful, in more complex situations, to divide larger problems into smaller subproblems.

Split the expression string into individual terms using whitespace as a delimiter.\n3. Extract integers from terms.\n4. Initialize an empty sum variable.\n5. Iterate through each term, compute the sum by adding each term with the accumulated sum.\n6. Return the final sum.\n\nStep-by-step subproblems:\n\n1. Parse and extract individual terms from the given expression string.\n2. Extract integers from each term.\n3. Initialize an empty sum variable (acc).\n4. Iterate through each term.\n5. Add each term to the accumulated sum (acc).\n6. Return the accumulated sum (acc).\n\nHere\'s an outline of the code:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(expression):\n    terms = expression.split(" ")\n    acc = sum(map(int, terms))\n    return acc\n\n# given expression: "4 + 25 + ..."\nexpression = "4 + 25 + ..."\nresult = add_numbers(expression)\nprint(f"The final result is: {result}")\n```\n\nMake sure you have the `map` and `sum` functions imported from the built-in `itertools` and the `int` function.\n\nFeel free to expand or adjust the code based on your specific requirements.

Action: 'Reasoning:\n\n1. Given an input number, add it to a running sum.\n2. Repeat step 1 for each number in the following list: [32, 55, 69, ..., 95, 41, 72, 16, 38, 71, 30]\n\nHere is a possible Python implementation based on this reasoning:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [32, 55, 69, ..., 95, 41, 72, 16, 38, 71, 30]\n\ndef add_numbers(numbers):\n    result = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        result += number\n    return result\n\nprint(add_numbers(numbers))\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to avoid writing a helper function, you can perform the summation as follows:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [32, 55, 69, ..., 95, 41, 72, 16, 38, 71, 30]\n\ntotal = 0\nfor number in numbers:\n    total += number\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nThis way, each step in the process corresponds to a single Python statement. This may not seem like significant decomposition, but it does help to demonstrate a mindset focused on breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable subproblems.\n\nKeep in mind that these examples focus on illustrating the decomposition process at a high level, without overly complicated code or extraneous details.

Action: "Reasoning:\n\n1. Given an expression with many addition operations, we can decompose it into a series of subproblems, where each subproblem represents adding two numbers.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Parse the input expression into a list of integers, where each integer represents a number to be added.\n2. Iterate through the list, and for each pair of numbers, add them using the `+` operator.\n\nCode: (In Python)\n\n```python\nnumbers = [16, 71, 78, ..., 48, 74, 32, 48] # Replace with the list of numbers from the input\nresult = 0\nfor current, next in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]):\n    result += current\n    result += next\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis approach breaks down a seemingly complex expression into smaller subproblems, each of which has an easy-to-understand solution.\n\nAlso, note this solution has a space complexity (O(1)) and a time complexity (O(n)), which is linear in the input size (number of integers in the list). This should be considered when optimizing the algorithm for larger inputs.\n\nFor completeness but not conciseness, Python's list comprehension can be utilized for one line input parsing in case it is necessary, like:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [int(i) for i in input_str.split() + ['0']] # assuming input_str = input().replace('\\n', ' ')\n```\n\nAlways consider the cost and benefit of using a concise or a long code solution.

Default Action: "Reasoning: To find the sum of given numbers, we can follow the addition principle which states that the sum of a quantity and another quantity is the same as putting them together.

The above method is easier to visually break down the problem subproblems. It can be argued that either method is acceptable as long"
