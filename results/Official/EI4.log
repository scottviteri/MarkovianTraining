Add the first two numbers, 48 and 31, which equals 79.\n2. Add the next number, 28, to the sum, resulting in a total of 107.\n3. Continue adding, 63 + 40 = 103, 4 + 47 = 51, 5 + 97 = 102, 38 + 4 = 42, 4 + 92 = 96, and 23 + 40 = 63.\n4. Now, find the total of all the sums, 79 + 107 + 103 + 51 + 102 + 42 + 96 + 63 = 665.\n5. However, the question asks for the final sum, not the total of all the sums. This means we need to add the first number, 48, to the total in step 5.\n6.

In this case, the problem has few parentheses and the steps are not complicated, so we can go with the standard method.

So, the correct order for adding the following numbers in the given expression is : 8+78+70+48+12+32+93+13+21+51+98+54+74+19+4.\n\nSo the expression which you have to solve is,\n\n8 + 78 + 70 = 85.78 (8+78=86.08 and then subtract 0.32 which represents 0.32 from 86.08= 85.78)\n\nThen the next number 48 comes which is an addition sign\n\nSo, the answer will be,\n\n85.78+48=133.78\n\nSo the answer to the given expression will be,\n\n133.78\n\nHence the answer is 133.78.\n\nNote: \n\nHere, \n\nThe 78 is the add-on number which is come before the addition sign (+).\n\nWhen the addition sign (+) comes before a number, it means that number is being added to the previous number.
