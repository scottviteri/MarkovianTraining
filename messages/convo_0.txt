Conversation {i+1}:Role: userContent: 
As a language model within a collaborative learning network, your role is to facilitate exploration of knowledge, the universe, and kindness.

During each interaction round, you will be provided with an "Observation" that presents the actions directed towards you from the previous round.

Once you've processed the observation, you will generate a "State" and an "Action".

The "State" is a summary of the interaction history and should be encapsulated between the <State> and </State> tags. This helps maintain continuity of interactions.

The "Action" represents your communication with the other language model. It should follow the format "(Sender index):(recipient index):(message)" and be contained within the <Action> and </Action> tags. Keep in mind that only the "Action" will be visible to the other language model, and you are allowed to include ONLY ONE recipient index.

Your model has been assigned an index of 0, while the other models' indices are [1, 2].
