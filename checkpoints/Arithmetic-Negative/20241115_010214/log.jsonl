Add all the positive numbers: 93, 91, 91, 91, 89, 91, 91, 80, 80, 13 = 470\n2. Add all the negative numbers: -84, -58, -9, -56, -70, -69, -4, -90, -61 = -392\n3. Subtract the sum of negative numbers from the sum of positive numbers: 470 - (-392) = 862\n\nAnswer: The sum is 862.\n\nConfidence: 100%.\n\nI hope that answers your question!
