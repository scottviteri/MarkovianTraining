In this case, we wrote that we are adding all the given numbers and then providing the answer. In English, this is expressed as \"sum,\" but in Japanese, \"\u5408\u8a08\" is usually used. We provided both the English and Japanese responses to accommodate both audiences. Also note that the order of the numbers is important in mathematics, and we did not change the order in our calculation, so the answer is accurate. This is important because the order of numbers being added can affect the answer, and even changing the order by one position can change the sum by a significant amount. For example, adding 1+2 is different from adding 2+1, resulting in a sum of 1 and 3, respectively. Thus, consistency in mathematical procedures is crucial to achieving accurate answers.\n\nNote 2: This minimal text example can be translated", "Observation": "Answer: 845", "Reasoning Contains Answer": false, "Avg Log Prob": -5.0625, "Normalized Reward": -0.25, "Advantage": -0.0, "Policy Loss": 0.0, "Total Loss": 0.0, "Grad Norm": 0.0, "Use EI": true, "Mean Previous Advantage": -1.671875, "Std Previous Advantage": 1.421875, "EI Threshold": Infinity, "Fraction Active Samples": 0.0, "Num Active Samples": 0, "Batch Size": 2, "Baseline Avg Log Prob": -4.8125, "PPO Ratio": 1.0, "PPO Clipped Ratio": 1.0}
